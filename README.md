## üìå Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Green AI Skills Internship**, powered by the **Edunet Foundation**, **AICTE**, and **Shell**. The primary goal was to analyze an existing open-source AI application, understand its complex architecture, and enhance it into a unified, user-friendly, and practical tool for farmers.

The result is a one-stop solution that provides farmers with AI-powered insights for Crop selection, Disease Prediction, Fertilizer recommendation and Weather planning, helping to improve yield and promote sustainability.

## üéØ Project Features & Results

### üåø 1. Smart Crop Recommendation

**Explanation:** This feature functions as an intelligent advisor for farmers. By providing 7 key environmental and soil parameters (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall), the system uses a machine learning model to predict the most suitable crop.

**Dataset Used:** The model was trained on the **Crop Recommendation dataset**, containing 2200 rows of data for 22 different crops. The dataset is available in the `datasets` folder (`Crop_recommendation.csv`).

**Model Training:** The complete model selection and training process can be reviewed in the Jupyter Notebook/VS Code : `training_files/Crop_Recommendation.ipynb`.
 
**Model Selection and Evaluation:** To ensure the highest accuracy, seven different machine learning algorithms were evaluated.

| Model Algorithm | Accuracy on Test Set (%) |
| :--- | :---: |
| **Random Forest** | **99.55%** |
| XGBoost | 99.09% |
| Gaussian Naive Bayes | 99.09% |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 97.5% |
| Logistic Regression | 95.23% |
| Decision Tree | 90% |
| Support Vector Machine (SVC)| 10.68% |

#### **Conclusion**

Based on the comparative analysis, the **Random Forest Classifier was selected** for the final application. It demonstrated superior performance by achieving the **highest accuracy of 99.55%**, proving its robustness and capability in handling the intricate patterns within the agricultural data to provide highly reliable crop recommendations.

### üî¨ 2. Smart Disease Recognition

**Explanation:** This module acts as a digital plant pathologist. Farmers can upload an image of a plant leaf, and a deep learning model analyzes it to identify one of 38 possible diseases. The system also provides an actionable remedy for the detected disease.

**Dataset Used:** The CNN was trained on the [**New Plant Diseases Dataset (Augmented)**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset) from Kaggle, which contains over 87,000 images (70,295 for training and 17,572 for validation) across 38 classes.
The dataset is available in the training_files folder (Crop_recommendation.csv).

**Model Used:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras.

**Results:** The CNN was trained for 10 epochs and demonstrated excellent learning capabilities.

* **Final Training Accuracy:** **98.12%**.
* **Final Validation Accuracy:** **96.52%**.

### üß™ 3. Smart Fertilizer Recommendation

**Explanation:** To ensure optimal plant nutrition, this feature recommends the best type of fertilizer. It uses a machine learning model that takes into account soil nutrient levels, climate conditions, and the specific crop being grown.

**Dataset Used:** The model was trained on the **Fertilizer Recommendation dataset**, which contains data for 7 different fertilizers based on soil and crop types. The dataset is available in the `training_files` folder (`Fertilizer_recommendation.csv`).

**Model Used:** `RandomForestClassifier` from Scikit-learn.

**Results:** The model was trained and evaluated, learning the complex relationships between the input parameters and the appropriate fertilizer type with a high degree of predictive accuracy.

* **Model Accuracy on the test set: 
:** **95.00%**.

### ‚òÄÔ∏è 4. Real-Time Weather Forecast

**Explanation:** This utility feature provides farmers with immediate access to real-time weather conditions for any location. This is crucial for planning activities like irrigation, fertilization, and pesticide application.

**Technology Used:** Live data is fetched using the **OpenWeatherMap API** and the `requests` library in Python.

**Results:** The feature successfully connects to the API and returns the current weather data for the user-specified city.
* **Displayed Data:** Temperature (¬∞C), Humidity (%), Wind Speed (m/s), and a general description of the weather conditions.
